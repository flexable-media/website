Consuming subtitled video content relies on a viewers ability to match up and understand a number of visual inputs simultaneously. This can create challenges in immersion due to the overall readability of subtitles and the speed at which they are presented. In this paper we introduce Graphic Novel Subtitles as an alternative media consumption method that is based on combining video keyframes with subtitle text to create a comic-type experience. We carry out a requirement elicitation survey with 34 participants in order to explore this concept in more detail and identify key features that we present as system requirements.We then introduce a system that can automatically generate a graphic novel from video and subtitle files, and discuss our future evaluation plans.
